# Test Bench Generation in C++
The objective of this project is to generate a testbench template for a Verilog Top module design, described in C++ language. The program reads a top file design and extract the necessary information to fill in the created testbench template. The complete connection process with the module and inputs/outputs is designed and adapted to be simulated in EDA PlaygroundÂ© environment. This program only works with traditional combinational Verilog designs.
